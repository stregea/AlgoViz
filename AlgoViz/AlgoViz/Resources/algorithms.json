This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.\n\nQuicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a 'less-than' relation (formally, a total order) is defined.\n\nEfficient implementations of Quicksort are not a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved."
